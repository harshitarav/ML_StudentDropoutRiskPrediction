# Student Dropout Analysis and Risk Prediction

## Problem Statement 
- Schools face rising student dropouts, driven by academic struggles, low engagement, and social or family pressures.
- Identifying which students are at risk early enables targeted support, improves retention, and strengthens long-term academic outcomes.
- This project builds a data-driven predictive model to flag at-risk students and uncover key drivers of dropout, guiding timely, personalized interventions.

## Dataset Overview
- Source: Kaggle
- Combination of numerical and categorical variables
- The target variable churn is not balanced. i.e we can see the ratio of yes: no as - 73:27
- Target Variable:
  - `0` → Stayed  
  - `1` → Dropped Out  
- Key Feature Categories:
  - Academic Achievement (Grades, Study Time, Failures)
  - Family Environment (Parental Education, Family Support)
  - Social Behavior (Alcohol Use, Going Out, Relationship Status)
  - Aspirations (Higher Education Plans)
  - Institutional Factors (School Type, Extra Paid Classes)
