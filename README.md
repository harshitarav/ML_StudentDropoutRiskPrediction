# Student Dropout Analysis and Risk Prediction

## Problem Statement 
- Schools face rising student dropouts, driven by academic struggles, low engagement, and social or family pressures.
- Identifying which students are at risk early enables targeted support, improves retention, and strengthens long-term academic outcomes.
- This project builds a data-driven predictive model to flag at-risk students and uncover key drivers of dropout, guiding timely, personalized interventions.
